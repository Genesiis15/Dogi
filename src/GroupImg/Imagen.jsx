            <p className='pimg'>We are a company with more than 30 years in the workplace, we are especially dedicated to training dogs from puppies to adults.
                What we think about "It's never too late to learn".
                The main objective is to help dog owners have a better relationship with their pets and improve coexistence between them.
                Trainers help new dog owners work with the dog in their own home. For example, trainers teach dogs to react when they hear sounds like an alarm clock or a doorbell by alerting their owner with a paw and directing them to the source of the sound.</p>
